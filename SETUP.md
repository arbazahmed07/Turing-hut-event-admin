## 6. Important Notes

- âœ… Your PAT is only stored in browser memory
- âœ… All edits/additions go through Pull Requests
- âœ… You can review PRs before merging on GitHub
- âœ… Delete operations are immediate (use carefully!)
- âœ… Works with both `.md` and `.mdx` files

## 7. Troubleshooting

**Can't authenticate?**

- Make sure your PAT has the `repo` scope
- Check that the token hasn't expired

**Can't see events?**

- Verify repository owner, name, and path are correct
- Make sure the events directory exists in your repo
- Check that your PAT has access to the repository

**PR creation failed?**

- Ensure you have write access to the repository
- Check if there's already a branch with the same name

## 8. Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your PAT** - Treat it like a password
2. **Use fine-grained tokens** if possible with minimal permissions
3. **Regenerate tokens periodically** for security
4. **Revoke unused tokens** at https://github.com/settings/tokens

## 9. Next Steps

After creating a PR:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to "Pull Requests"
3. Review the changes
4. Merge the PR when ready

Enjoy managing your events! ðŸŽ‰
